Thoughts:
    1. mozilla has a built in color picking tool
    2. responsive design is very finicky / interesting
    3. box shadows are very subtle but I can appreciate them
    4. If I need a shadow that has different border-radius than element I can always just add a wrapping div and add the shadow to that
